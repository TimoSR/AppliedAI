    "Traditional machine learning algorithms refer to a set of well-established techniques and methods that have been widely used in the field of machine learning, predating the recent surge in popularity of deep learning and artificial neural networks. These algorithms are based on statistical and mathematical principles and are typically easier to interpret and understand than deep learning models. Some of the most common traditional machine learning algorithms include:\n",

    "1. Linear Regression: A simple algorithm used for modeling the relationship between a continuous target variable and one or more input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Logistic Regression: A variation of linear regression used for binary classification tasks, where the goal is to predict one of two possible classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Support Vector Machines (SVM): A classification and regression method that seeks to find the optimal separating hyperplane between different classes or to model the relationship between input features and a continuous target variable.\n",
